During GPS2, a portable pipeline named GPS Pipeline is being developed which will enable collaborators to easily input whole genome sequencing data and generate the *in silico* typing data required for downstream analysis. The pipeline is still under active development, its latest version is available on GitHub: [https://github.com/GlobalPneumoSeq/gps-pipeline](https://github.com/GlobalPneumoSeq/gps-pipeline)"
