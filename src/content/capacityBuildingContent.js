As such, a key focus of the second phase of the GPS project (GPS2) is to establish a sustainable genomic surveillance system with an emphasis on decentralisation of data generation and analysis, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where the burden of pneumococcal disease is high. In view of the variation in local infrastructure and resources, we devises bespoke support for project partners to cater for different needs in sequencing, training and mentorship.',
